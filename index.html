                It’s possible to cycle every day, especially if you use your bicycle for transportation or ride at a low intensity.

                Take a break if you experience pain, fatigue, or muscle soreness.

                If you’re cycling for fitness, you may want to give yourself at least 1 full day of rest each week — especially if your rides are longer or higher in intensity. Exercise scientists agree that recovery is necessary to prevent injury and enhance performance.

                This is especially important if you ride at a high intensity or find your body getting sore in specific ways.

                Cycling is an enjoyable way to stay healthy and in touch with the world around you.

                If the weather is in your favor, hop on your bike and go the distance. Cycling is a wonderful way to explore your local area. And it beats the feeling of boredom that can come from repetitive workouts.

                Just play it safe and use caution when necessary, especially on busy roads or during inclement weather.

                When the weather is not conducive to outdoor cycling, indoor cycling is a great option that’s somewhat less risky and offers many health benefits.

                Either way you ride a bike, appreciate the satisfaction that comes from improving your fitness while having fun.

            </div>

                It’s one of the rawest and most pure forms of flight. It involves the use of a paraglider, where the pilot sits in a harness which is suspended by a large, curved fabric wing. There is no engine, pilots launch by running and obtaining lift. The curve in the wing enables a skilled pilot to glide over long distances and to climb to high altitudes. Steering is conducted by pulling handles which are located beside each shoulder.

                Paragliding is one of the simplest forms of flight and easiest to get involved in. It’s a popular hobby for those who not only enjoy the skill and thrill of flight, but also enjoy the outdoors and the amazing overhead views obtainable.

                However, like other forms of flight, paragliding takes time to learn and master. There are dangers involved and loss of control, sudden weather change, or mishandled equipment can result in death.
                <br> <br>
                Paragliding has a relatively short history, involving many people across the United States and France. Early versions of paragliding were derived from the preexisting parachute, which was round in shape, and designed to descent safely.

                The earliest known paragliding was performed by the US military in their parachute landing training. Repeatedly flying soldiers back into the air to jump out of a plane was time consuming. It was less costly, less time consuming and enabled more jumps to be performed in the day if soldiers made their own way into the air through paragliding.

                As we’ve already said, there’s not an overload of surfing in India. The scene is growing but it’s still limited to just a few beaches and beach towns. We’ve listed the best of them below, but remember that this country is all about adventure – there’s still bound to be countless secret spots (we’re not gonna’ spill the beans on em’ though!) in hiding for those willing to do the legwork!
                <br> <br>
                If we had to pick the bona fide capital of surfing in India, it would have to be Goa. This small state is famed around the globe for its beaches, and for good reason – they are stunning. For waves, it’s also got a good west-facing shoreline that attracts regular 3-5f foot swells in the monsoon seasons. Beaches in the north are among the most popular for starters, and the have neat nightlife scenes too. To the south are places like Palolem, where bodyboarders take to the whitewash waves most of the time. There are also some smaller little resort towns. But there’s not much left hidden in Goa – it’s pretty developed.
